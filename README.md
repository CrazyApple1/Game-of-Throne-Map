Winter is here! Weâ€™re pretty amped for the final season of Game of Thrones. Since we love GOT and love making maps, we thought we'd combine the two with this Game of thrones-inspired map style.

Bring this style directly into you Mapbox Studio account here: [] https://www.mapbox.com/studio/styles/add-style/mapbox/cjuah12up9qs41fo96ruvf7x8/?utm_medium=community&utm_source=github&utm_campaign=community|github|mobile|GOT-Inspired-map-19-05&utm_term=mobile&utm_content=GOT-Inspired-map

## My Refining Styles
Following is my refined [map styles](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/huangyixiu/cjuo5ww3v1n711eqgmniofos5.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiaHVhbmd5aXhpdSIsImEiOiJjanVzaWFjbmMwMHg4M3lxdzY0YjByeGJmIn0.i8X6qndaM8f3LaNoRtuRhw#5.1/0.762392/19.638807/1)

- Refining map palette, with more natural colors and land use patterns.
- Refining text label fonts to make it more readable, since I can not recognize diversity of fonts in original map styles.
- Add few more icons and enhanced the label weight, weighs castle label more than city/town label.

Publish your finished map and share it with us on twitter #builtwithmapbox.

## 3D Terrain
Terrain image produced by band calculation and post-handmade (photoshop) is included for constructing terrain layer. More help is wanted to extend the terrain out of Westeros.
